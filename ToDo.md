# VR Design Lab To-do list

## To-do:
- Get reticle to draw always in front of everything else.  Not sure how to do this, but Google Design lab seems to do this.
- Lab 6-10 forest scene, or make 5 mini scenes that demonstrate the labs differently
- Lab 3, train models still waiting for Blake
- Need better button graphics for Reset, Home, Next.
- Test and fix reset button for every lab.
- Nicer backgrounds and floors
